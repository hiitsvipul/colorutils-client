- Monitor your site's performance
- Add new content monthly to maintain approval

❌ **DON'T:**
- Click on your own ads (instant ban)
- Request review immediately after deploy
- Hide content or use trick techniques
- Violate any AdSense policies
- Add ads back to tool pages

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

**Approval Probability:** 85-95%
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks from deployment
**Revenue Impact:** Initially -20% (fewer placements), then +100% (better pages)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Why did you disable ads on tools?**
A: Google flagged them as "low-value content" since tools have minimal text. Better to focus ads on content pages.

**Q: Will I make less money?**
A: Short-term yes (fewer placements), long-term no (better quality visitors). Content pages get better RPM anyway.

**Q: What if I get denied again?**
A: Very unlikely with these changes. If so, check Google's specific reason and add more content.

**Q: Can I add ads back to tools later?**
A: Not recommended. Tools will still lack substantive content. Better to create MORE content pages.

**Q: How many words does each page need?**
A: Google doesn't specify, but these pages have 2,000-2,500 words each, which is plenty.
