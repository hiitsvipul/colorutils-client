# ✅ AdSense Compliance Complete Summary

## What Was Wrong

❌ **Policy Violation:** "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
- Ads were enabled on tool pages (Screen Picker, Converter, etc.)
- These pages had minimal content (just interactive tools)
- Google flagged this as low-quality content with ads

All 7 tool pages now show placeholder ads only:
- Contrast Checker

- Statistics on color impact
- **Ads:** Banner + Rectangle

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Home Page
Added new content sections:
